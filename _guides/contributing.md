## What you will need

You will need a GitHub account.

If you are comfortable using GitHub, you can open pull requests on the repository (if you are part of the [dxw organisation](https://github.com/dxw) and the [staff team](https://github.com/orgs/dxw/teams/staff)), or fork the repository and open a pull request from there.

If you prefer a graphic interface, you can use the [Netlify admin interface](https://dxw-playbook-v20.netlify.app/admin), which will open a pull request on your behalf using a branch on the dxw repository (if you are part of the dxw organisation), or by forking the repo into your account.

## Why GitHub?

We are all encouraged to help shape dxw and help it grow. The decisions we make
are represented in the Playbook so it's important to have an open and
collaborative means to evolve it.

GitHub allows us to:

1. Present our ideas against those existing
2. Discuss other people's ideas
3. Find agreement and get things changed
4. Store a history of our decision making

## Decide if new content is for the Playbook

### It’s in the Playbook if

* it’s a principle explained in plain english.
* it’s something we want to/are comfortable to share outside of dxw.
* we want it to be visible to the wider team.
* it's user research or design glossary.

### It’s in guides if

* it’s a detailed, step by step instruction.
* we’re talking about something specialist. This could mean we are using jargon
  and referring to community-known methods and ways of working.

### It’s something else if

* it’s something visual and reusable, it will likely belong in the brandbook.
* it’s a good, work-related read, there may be a repository to put it in.
* it’s a poster it should be succinct, large-print friendly and something we
  want to share with the wider dxw team. It’s also something we want clients to
  see and understand. It belongs in the brandbook.

## Merging pull requests

When the create or edit steps are followed the result is a pull request, which
is essentially a request for a change to be added to the Playbook. Merging a
pull request means accepting a change into the Playbook.

Anyone who is part of the staff team on Github can approve and merge pull
requests.

1. To see the open pull requests, visit
   <https://github.com/dxw/playbook/pulls>
2. Click on the name of the pull request you want to review
3. The page for an invididual pull request has several tabs, the most important
   ones are `Conversation` and `Files changed`. Take the time to read the pull
   request description (in the `Conversation` tab) to understand why this change
   was made, and any futher comments on this page.
4. Click on `Files changed` to see the actual changes made to the Playbook.
   Lines removed will be marked in red, and lines added marked in green. If you
   want to see the changes in context, click on `View file` (top right) to see
   the amended Playbook as a whole.
5. If you are happy with the changes, click on the green `Review changes` button
   in the top right. Select the `Approve` radio button and add any comments you
   have about the changes. Then click `Submit review`.
6. If you think the changes need more work before merging, click on the
   `Review changes` button and select the `Request changes` radio button. Use
   the comment form to let the editor know what changes you wish to see, then
   click `Submit review`. The editor will recieve notification of your comments.
7. When you are happy with the changes in the pull request, you can click the
   green `Merge pull request` button on the `Conversation` tab.

The Playbook is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and it's
tracking the `main` branch. This means changes will be published automatically
when a pull request is merged.
